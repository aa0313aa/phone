Backup of reports and archived posts

This folder contains a snapshot of `reports/` and `archived_posts/` for safe-keeping.

- `reports/` : Lighthouse reports and audit artifacts
- `archived_posts/` : original root blog pages preserved during migration

If you want these removed or moved, delete or move them and update this README.
